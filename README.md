# gorcheat
This is a small cheat utility for the [The Game of
Robot](http://www.game-of-robot.de/).  It's a relatively old but insanely good
game that originally came out for DOS, but was later ported to Windows (and
runs great under Wine). The savegames for GoR1 can be edited with this tool
(any items can be added to the inventory, including obviously save game
clocks).

Note that I played a bit with the scene decoding within the savegames, but
didn't get very far. And, to be fair, if you want to cheat, then what is
presented here is enough. However, when I'm feeling like it, this could likely
be extended to also work with other games of the Robot series (I've not
checked, but am fairly certain that the formats are similar).

Have fun. If you like the game, please buy it.
